# Jane street card deck puzzle
So recently I participated in a programming competition. I had fun, we solved 5 problems out of 12, better then the last time so I'm happy. I flew back to London from Germany and started to look at the goodies I got from the contest sponsors, among which was a deck of cards from Jane Street. I just open them to examine the quality when I find an additional card at the end. For the next hour or so I was frantically solving a puzzle in it's natural habitat: found accidentally.

At this point I was still not sure if I'm imagining things. It also didn't help that when I opened the deck the cards where not in any particular order. When I saw the last card, being a bit too meticulous for my own good, I quickly wrote down the order the cards were in. It didn't come up in the solution and it would be a bit weird if such volatile information would be important, but I still have it saved just in case.

Here are all of the other cards layed out and a few relevant to the additional card:

**Disclamer: in this write-up I will completely spoil the solution**
